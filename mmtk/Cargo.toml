# Be very careful to commit any changes to the following mmtk dependency, as our CI scripts (including mmtk-core CI)
# rely on matching these lines to modify them: e.g. change ssh to https with token or comment out the git dependency
# and use the local path.
# These changes are safe:
# - change branch
# - change repo name
# But other changes including adding/removing whitespaces in commented lines may break the CI.
